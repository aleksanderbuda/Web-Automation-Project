* **Streamlined Maintenance:** Leverages _Page Object Model_ (POM) for clean code, easy updates, and long-term efficiency.
* **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Guarantees flawless functionality across Chrome, Edge, and Firefox using Selenium Grid with Docker.
* **Flexible Execution**: Effortlessly switch between local testing and scaled-up testing using _Selenium Grid with Docker_.
* **Insightful Reporting**: Generates clear, interactive test reports with the _allure-reports_ library for data-driven analysis.
* **CI/CD Ready**: Seamless integration into automated jobs, with adaptable configuration options.
* **Easy Customization**: Offers a _config.properties file for simple tailoring of test behavior.
* **Behavior-Driven Development**: Incorporates Cucumber to support BDD, allowing tests to be written in a more natural, readable format.
